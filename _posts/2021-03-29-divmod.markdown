When I originally learned to program (Java back in 2010), we always had to use different operators to get the quotient and remainder. In Python, it’s a double-slash `//` for integer division and the percent `%` for modulo to get the remainder.

```python
quotient = 10 // 3
remainder = 10 % 3 
```
I usually ended up needing both values and back then often wished there was a single built-in function that returned both. Well, fast-forward 11 years and one Google search later, I discovered that such convenience has already existed in python. (In my defense, I haven’t needed to revisit modulo until recently which prompted this journey of discovery).

```python
quotient, remainder = divmod(10, 3)
```
Well, that’s one less line on code in the never-ending quest to write clean and concise programs!

In the meantime, it’s also a good time to review Python’s [built-in methods](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html). Some of my personal favs are list comprehensions using [any()](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#any) or [all()](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#all).
